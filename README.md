# Final Year Projects

This repository contains my final-year project Protien intake and muscel mass analysis implemented as reproducible Jupyter notebooks.

- notebooks/ — Jupyter notebooks for each project
- data/ — datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fgloblek/protein-intake-and-muscle-mass-data-pmc7727026)
- src/ — helper scripts and modules
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
- README.md — this file

## Notes
- Large datasets are not included in the repository. See each project notebook for dataset sources and download instructions or links.
- Consider usingBinder, Google Colab, or a pinned environment to reproduce results more easily; add configuration files (environment.yml / runtime.txt) if you want hosted execution.
