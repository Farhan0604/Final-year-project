## Overview
The Lean Body Mass (LBM) Prediction App is a machine learning web application that predicts a user’s lean body mass based on inputs like protein intake, energy intake, BMI, age, training duration, and workout frequency. Built with Flask (backend) and HTML/CSS (frontend), it uses a Random Forest Regressor model to provide accurate, data-driven fitness insights.
The app demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing and model training to web-based deployment through an API. It aims to make personalized fitness tracking simple and accessible for users.
In future updates, the system can include additional factors like gender, sleep quality, and wearable integration to enhance prediction accuracy and usability.

Machine Learning: Python, Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)
Backend: Flask (API-based deployment)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
